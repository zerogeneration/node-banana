# Changelog

All notable changes to Node Banana will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BytePlus / OpenAI image / ElevenLabs run through the zerogen engine** — These three providers cut over from the in-process `@zerogeneration/providers/node-banana` library-embed to the fork's execution-adapter talking to the zerogen engine over HTTP. The engine holds their provider keys server-side, so node-banana's per-provider BYOK 401 gates are removed and no `BYTEPLUS_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is needed for generation. Point node-banana at the engine via `ZEROGEN_ENGINE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:4747`) and `ZEROGEN_PROJECT` (default `node-banana`). gemini / replicate / fal / kie / wavespeed are unchanged.
- **Adopt the published `@zerogeneration/engine-client` contract** — The adapter's vendored engine contract mirror is retired; its engine wire/body types are now aliases over the published package, so they can't drift from the engine. The private `@zerogeneration/providers` dependency is dropped (GitHub Packages auth via `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` is still required for `engine-client`).

### Added

- **BytePlus Seedream image-to-image + OpenAI `background`/`n`** — Now that the engine image contract carries reference `images`, `extra`, `background`, and `n` (PRO-110), these survive the round trip instead of failing closed / being dropped.
- **Seedance first/last-frame video + provider video params** — Upgraded to `@zerogeneration/engine-client@0.1.4`. The engine video contract now carries `firstFrame`/`lastFrame` (Seedance first/last-frame interpolation, mutually exclusive with reference images) and an `extra` passthrough, so node-banana's `first_frame_url`/`last_frame_url` route to dedicated fields and provider params like `seed`/`resolution` reach the model instead of being silently dropped.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Seedance 2 I2V: richer media inputs** — The ByteDance Seedance 2.0 and 2.0 Fast image-to-video nodes now expose Last Frame, Reference Images (up to 9), Reference Videos (up to 3), and Reference Audio (up to 3) handles alongside First Frame. Handle descriptions document the First/Last Frame vs Reference Images mutual-exclusivity rule.

### Fixed

- **Seedance 2 I2V: reference-only runs no longer rejected** — When connecting images only to Reference Images, the request no longer duplicates them into `first_frame_url`, which Kie was rejecting as a mutually-exclusive combination.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Onboarding & setup flow** — New first-run setup experience to get users configured and started quickly
- **Interactive tutorial** — Guided onboarding tutorial that walks first-time users through the workflow editor with mock execution and step-by-step demonstration
- **Kie.ai model expansion** — Added 7 new image models, Kling 3.0 / 3.0 Motion Control, Wan 2.7 (text-to-video & image-to-video), and Seedance 2.0 / 2.0 Fast video models
- **Model fallback/redundancy** — Generation nodes now support a fallback model that automatically kicks in if the primary model fails, with a dedicated settings tab for configuring fallback parameters
- **Loop edges** — Connect a node's output back to an upstream input with magenta-styled loop edges and configurable iteration counts via an edge toolbar
- **Client-side polling** — Long-running Kie tasks now return immediately and poll for results on the client side, keeping the UI responsive during video/3D generation
- **Download buttons** — All media-displaying nodes (image, video, audio, 3D) now have download buttons
- **Output gallery extraction** — New "Extract" button on OutputGalleryNode to batch-create input nodes from gallery items
- **Handle labels** — Connection handles now show descriptive labels on hover/select/drag for easier wiring

### Fixed

- **Video handle and edge colors** — Unified video handles, labels, and edges to consistent pink styling
- **Loop execution reliability** — Fixed downstream observer collection during loop iterations, validated loop counts, and handled resume inside loops
- **Orphaned edge cleanup** — Edges referencing deleted nodes are now filtered out on workflow load
- **Audio stitching** — Embedded audio is preserved when stitching video segments
- **Kie API compatibility** — Fixed Seedance 2.0 model ID mapping, schema defaults pre-population, and video/audio upload handling

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Audio-to-video generation** — Video generation nodes now accept audio inputs, enabling audio-driven video workflows with handle rendering, connection validation, model discovery, and drop-menu wiring
- **Array batch mode** — New batch execution mode that sequentially generates from all items in an array, with shared helper logic across all execution entry points

### Fixed

- **Undo/redo memory bloat** — Eliminated excessive memory usage caused by deep-cloning base64 image blobs in history snapshots; clipboard and snapshot operations now use a string-preserving clone
- **Cancellable batch execution** — Wired AbortController into `regenerateNode` so batch runs can be properly cancelled
- **Output gallery correctness** — Output gallery now reads fresh node data to preserve all batch-generated images
- **Array batch behavior** — Batch mode is now derived dynamically from the source node rather than being statically configured
- **UI polish** — Normalized button sizes in array node headers and repositioned batch/auto-route controls inline with split rows

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Video Input node** — Upload, preview, and wire video files through workflows with drag-and-drop support, native playback controls, and full-bleed styling matching Image Input nodes
- **Undo/Redo** — Full undo/redo history with Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z, intelligently coalescing multi-node deletions into single undo steps
- **Veo model parameters** — Aspect ratio, quality, and duration controls now render in the Generate Video node UI

- **Media Externalization** — videos and audio now save alongside images in the generations/ folder for portable workflows
- **Optional Inputs & Skip Propagation** — mark input nodes as optional; execution skips downstream nodes when optional inputs are empty
